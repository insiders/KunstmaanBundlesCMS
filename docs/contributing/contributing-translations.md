# Contributing translation

We have chosen to make all bundle translations available at the translation platform "Crowdin".

If you work on a patch for KunstmaanBundlesCMS, adding new phrases is really simple and works like with any Symfony application.
You add the new translation keys to the YAML formatted files in bundle's Resources/translations directory. 

When new phrases are added in English, you have to create an account on https://kunstmaancms.be/translate-ui. 
The UI is very intuitive and all you need is to navigate to correct language and start translating the files!

Currently, the synchronization needs to be performed manually.
Kunstmaan team will use the sync commands and add new translations to the GitHub repository.

Translations can be managed at https://kunstmaancms.be/translate-ui
